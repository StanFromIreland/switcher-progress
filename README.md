# switcher-progress

This repository contains a workflow for verifying that a translation meets the
PEP 545 language switcher requirements, update with the latest messages
(i.e., whatever version `/3/` points to).

It can be run from the
[Actions tab](https://github.com/StanFromIreland/switcher-progress/actions/workflows/switcher-requirements-progress.yml)
by selecting "Run workflow" and specifying the translation's language code (e.g.
`pl` or `ro`).
